## Hi there 👋

Minimalist in real life, Maximalist in the digital world──.  
I've been learning Python and Chrome Extensions / Firefox Add-ons(Javascript, HTML, CSS, etc...).  
  
## ⚒️ My projects  
### 🌸 - [100Project Challenge](https://github.com/Yohey-mk/100_project_challenge)  
The title says it's all. I've been learning coding in python by creating 100 apps.  
I've created 25 apps so far and I'm excited to see how much I'd learn coding!  
### 🐏 - [Sleek Favorites](https://github.com/Yohey-mk/SleekFavorites)  
A minimalist style homepage. It will help you focus on what you actually want to do.  
In order to handpick what to list on the favorite section, you'll have to think which bookmarks you really need.  
Going through this process, I believe, will help you reduce screen time.  
### 📖 - [Instant Copy Hub](https://github.com/Yohey-mk/InstantCopyHub)  
As the title says, it is one of the simplest note keeper extension.  
All you have to do is to add whatever text you want to keep so that you can copy quickly.  
After you add notes, simply open the extension and hit the copy button.  
### 📝 - [(WIP)Locally ToDo](https://github.com/Yohey-mk/Locally_ToDo)  
I'm working on this ToDoList app, which will be minimalistic style and simple to use.
